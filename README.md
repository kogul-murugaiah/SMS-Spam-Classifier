# Spam Message Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting spam messages. With the increasing amount of unsolicited and potentially harmful messages, it's crucial to have an efficient system in place to filter out such content. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify messages as spam or non-spam.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is a collection of labeled SMS messages, where each message is annotated as either spam or ham (non-spam). 
## Approach
### Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: The messages are tokenized into individual words to extract features.
- **Normalization**: Text is converted to lowercase to ensure consistency.
- **Removal of Stopwords**: Common stopwords are removed to focus on meaningful words.
- **Feature Engineering**: Additional features such as message length, presence of special characters, etc., are extracted to improve model performance.

### Model Selection
- Several machine learning algorithms are explored, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Random Forest
- Models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Model Evaluation
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness and generalization of the models.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is in the appropriate format (e.g., CSV) and contains labeled messages.
2. **Model Training**: Run the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks to train the model on the dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using the provided evaluation scripts or notebooks.
4. **Deployment**: Integrate the trained model into an application or service for real-time spam detection.

## Dependencies

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for improved performance.
- Incorporate additional features or meta-data to enhance model accuracy.
